                     Brazillian Jiu Jitsu is considered one of the world's most effective and realistic fighting systems.
                     Jiu-Jitsu was developed by the Gracie Family based on the premise that 90% of all fights end on the
                     ground.
                     The essence of Jiu-Jitsu is effective ground fighting. The goal is to force an opponent to submit by
                     applying joint locks and/or chokes on the ground. It is the science of using leverage, human body
                     mechanics,
                     balance, and technique to create favorable situations against a live/larger opponent. MMA's ground game
                     is
                     based on Jiu Jitsu.

                     It's similar to BJJ(gi), except no-gi practitioners tend to wear rash guards and MMA shorts instead of
                     the
                     traditional uniform. If you don't submit your opponent, it will be declared a draw, no points are scored
                     in
                     this type of competition. Although in some instances, a judge will announce a winner.

                  <p>
                     The worst-case scenario in self-defense, short of being held at knife or gunpoint, is being pinned under
                     an
                     attacker and taking a beating from blows or being smashed into the ground.<br>BJJ basics place a lot of
                     emphasis on getting out of awkward positions, regaining guard, and either standing
                     up, sweeping, or submitting the guy who had you pinned.<br>BJJ provides the resources necessary for some
                     of
                     the hardest circumstances you could encounter.<br>Although grappling systems like wrestling and judo are
                     also excellent, BJJ has much better strategies for
                     getting out of some of the worst situations and provides a sophisticated and dangerous arsenal of
                     techniques
                     to take out opponents from the ground.
