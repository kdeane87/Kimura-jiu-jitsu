                    Jiu Jitsu creates a uniqe mindset, when things are going against you it forces you to improvise,
                    adapt and overcome bad situations. A state of mind that will spill over into your daily life too!

            <p id="history">
                Brazillian Jiu Jitsu is considered one of the world's most effective and realistic fighting systems.
                Jiu-Jitsu was developed by the Gracie Family based on the premise that 90% of all fights end on the
                ground.
                The essence of Jiu-Jitsu is effective ground fighting. The goal is to force an opponent to submit by
                applying joint locks and/or chokes on the ground. It is the science of using leverage, human body
                mechanics,
                balance, and technique to create favorable situations against a live/larger opponent. MMA's ground game
                is
                based on Jiu Jitsu.

            <p>
                It's similar to BJJ(gi), except no-gi practitioners tend to wear rash guards and MMA shorts instead of
                the
                traditional uniform. If you don't submit your opponent, it will be declared a draw, no points are scored
                in
                this type of competition. Although in some instances, a judge will announce a winner.

            <h2>BJJ addresses worst-case scenarios </h2>
            <hr class="hr-75-white">
            <p>
                The worst-case scenario in self-defense, short of being held at knife or gunpoint, is being pinned under
                an
                attacker and taking a beating from blows or being smashed into the ground.<br>BJJ basics place a lot of
                emphasis on getting out of awkward positions, regaining guard, and either standing
                up, sweeping, or submitting the guy who had you pinned.<br>BJJ provides the resources necessary for some
                of
                the hardest circumstances you could encounter.<br>Although grappling systems like wrestling and judo are
                also excellent, BJJ has much better strategies for
                getting out of some of the worst situations and provides a sophisticated and dangerous arsenal of
                techniques
                to take out opponents from the ground.
